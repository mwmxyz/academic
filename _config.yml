resume_header_intro: "<p>My research centers on the intersection of game writing and game design, with particular attention to how narrative craft interacts with systemic mechanics. I am especially interested in points where narrative elements—dialogue, rules text, quest structure—affect balance, difficulty, and pacing in ways typically described as design rather than writing. This allows me to frame game balance as a narrative tool, where adjustments in systems create new story rhythms and shape player experience.Methodologically, I combine practice-led prototyping with critical analysis of player communities. I look at how players interpret rules as stories, and stories as rules, across contexts such as modding, streaming, and classroom playtests. These sites show how narrative authority is shared between designers and players, and how creative writing in games extends into computational and communal domains. In pedagogy, I build curriculum models where the classroom operates as a design space. Students test mechanics and prose in tandem, with assessment structured around iteration, playtest documentation, and collaborative design. My broader aim is to develop frameworks that help writers think in systems and designers use narrative techniques, producing tools that can support both creative writing education and game studies research."

# resume_header_intro: "<p>My research and professional interests involve the overlap of Game Writing and Game Design, specifically the ways that Creative Writing can re-define the boundaries of what counts as Game Design. This has lately involved the concept of Game Balance, which is an area less often touched on in studies of game narratives, but which could provide narrative writers a way to address directly more quantitative and computational elements of design. (Put more simply, at what point does Game Writing become indistinguishable from Game Design?)<p>I specialize in curriculum innovation through game dynamics. With a core skill set that includes instructional design, educational technology integration, and game theory, I create immersive learning experiences.</p>"
